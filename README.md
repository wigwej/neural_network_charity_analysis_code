# neural_network_charity_analysis_code

***Overview***

Our goal is to create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants for a charity fun will be successfully funded by Alpha company. Over the last years, applicants for funding have exceeded 34000 orhanizations. We would deploy macjine learning and neural networks algorithms to preprocess, train, compile and evaluate the dataset to create a binary classifier.
